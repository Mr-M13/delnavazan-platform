    # [C8-3] Both deliveries must be in flight together, so neither worker holds a lock: each announces
    # itself in the gate directory and waits for its sibling before submitting the same provider event
    # identity, and the unique `provider_event` index arbitrates the race. [C9-1] The decision-claim
    # races use the same gate: both deliveries reach the one owed decision together, and the unique
    # `event_claim` index arbitrates which of them may complete it.
    # [C10-2] `stale_owner_after_lease_expiry` uses the same gate in the other direction: the first
    # worker announces itself from inside the decision it owns, ages its own lease past expiry and then
    # waits for the second worker's record, so the successor takes the claim over *before* the first
    # workers resumes its decision work.
    # [C11-1] `stale_owner_inside_r1_unit` / `stale_owner_inside_r2_unit` reuse the gate inside a work
    # unit: the first worker stalls *inside* an R1/R2 mutation with its own window aged, the second worker
    # delivers while it is stalled (it can own nothing and works nowhere), and once the fence has rolled the
    # stalled unit back and released the claim, the second worker completes the event's decision.
    # [C12-1] `stale_owner_at_decision_append` uses the gate in the other direction again: the first worker
    # lets its own window lapse *after* its last R1/R2 work unit — the append seam of the decision operation —
    # with no successor having taken its claim over, and the second worker delivers only once the first has
    # returned, so the append fence (never a take-over) is what refuses the stale generation and the next
    # delivery is what completes the event. The claim row is never written for this mode: the window lapses in
    # real elapsed time, so this one mode runs for the structural 120-second decision-claim lease before the
    # second worker is released.
