#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Offline regression coverage for the runtime path-boundary guards.
#
# The runtime contract requires every worktree, database, WordPress and
# plugin-source path to be resolved and validated before use, symlinked
# worktree paths to be refused, any path resolving outside the canonical state
# directory to be refused, and an externally supplied DZN_PLUGIN_SOURCE to be
# unable to bypass that validation.  This file proves each clause:
#
#   * a pre-existing symlink or alias below the state directory is refused even
#     though its lexical path looks disposable;
#   * a symlinked worktree path is refused even when it resolves inside the
#     state directory, and the shared checkout can never be reused as source;
#   * the guards run again at the container entry points, so a path retargeted
#     after `common.sh` was sourced still cannot reach docker;
#   * the state directory itself is never a disposable path, a broad shared
#     directory (`/`, `/tmp`, `/var`, the home directory, an ancestor of the
#     shared checkout) is refused as runtime state, and destructive cleanup only
#     ever deletes the children this harness itself creates;
#   * genuinely disposable paths still work.
#
# No cached image, container, network call or shared-checkout write is
# involved: the only writes are inside one private temporary directory and
# `docker` is replaced by a recording stub.
